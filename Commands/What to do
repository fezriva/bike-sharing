I want to see two different things in the first place:

Routes

 - keys are the end stations and value are all the start stations related to it and how many time that route was made - Done
 - set endStation and find which are the best stations to advertise (clustering) by measuring probability of target


Users
 - avg trip duration and distance based on User type


    Trip Duration (seconds)
    Start Time and Date
    End Time and Date
    Start Station ID
    Start Station Name
    Start Station Latitude
    Start Station Longitude
    End Station ID
    End Station Name
    End Station Latitude
    End Station Longitude
    Bike ID
    User Type (Subscriber or Customer – “Subscriber” = Member or “Customer” = Casual)
    Birth Year
    Sex
